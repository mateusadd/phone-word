Given a string of numbers, you must perform a method in which you will translate this string into text, following the next image.

1 - separate
2 abc
3 def
4 ghi
5 jkl
6 mno
7 pqrs
8 tuv
9 wxyz
0 space

for example if you get 22 you will b, if you get 222 you will return c. if you get 2222 return ca

Here some samples:

443355555566604466690277733099966688 -> hello how are you., 55282 -> kata.

    1 is used to separate letters with the same number.

    always transform the number to the letter with the maximum value, as long as it does not have a 1 in the middle.

    777777 = "sq". 7717777 = "qs".

    you cannot type digits

    0 are spaces in the string.

    Given a empty string, return empty string.

    Return a lowercase string.
